# Web-scraper-Ruby-capstone-project
# Descritption

- This is a web Scraper, that means, we will access a specific website and try to retrieve datas from it using this program.

- To Run This program you need to open your teminal and run: bin\index.rb

- The scraper will derectly access the webpage for you and will return the datas from the first page.

- In this case, the website we will be scraping is a job listing website: https://www.jobcoconut.com/job-search

-The first ouput you will get is the different information that we are getting from the first page, which are 

# job's title

# job's location

# Expected salary

# Name of the employer

# posted date

# links which are the direct link to those particular jobs.

- You will then be asked to enter the number of another page to be added to the output that we already have.

-You can keep adding pages untill you feel like quiting and when you press 0, the program will create a CSV file called jobs.csv and store our jobs along with all the informations inside of it
